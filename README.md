# CosmosFPGA
This project and research is directed towards accelerating data bases by using a Cosmos FPGA (XC7Z045-3FFG900 Zynq-7000).


## Goals of this project:
1) Connecting COSMOS FPGA to a host PC using Xillybus and then Implementing data transfer over PCIe.
2) Accelerating SQLite by implementing an enhanced version of the merge sort algorithm on the FPGA.

## Part 1: Connecting COSMOS FPGA to a host PC over PCIe.
### Requirements: 
1) Cosmos+ board (can be obtained [Here](http://www.openssd.io/)).
2) Xillybus bundle (can be obtained [Here](http://xillybus.com/downloads/xillybus-eval-zynq-pcie-2.0d.zip)).
