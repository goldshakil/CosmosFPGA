# CosmosFPGA
This project and research is directed towards accelerating data bases by using a Cosmos FPGA (XC7Z045-3FFG900 Zynq-7000).


## The Project has been divided into two main parts__
1) Connecting COSMOS FPGA to a host PC using Xillybus and then Implementing data transfer over PCIe.
2) Accelerating SQLite by implementing an enhanced version of the merge sort algorithm on the FPGA.
